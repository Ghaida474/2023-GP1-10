# Business Gate Project

## Introduction

The Kingdom's Vision 2030 serves as a guiding blueprint for Saudi Arabia's future, seeking to diversify the economy, reduce dependence on oil, and enhance public services such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation, and tourism. Universities within the Kingdom, particularly King Saud University (KSU), are instrumental in achieving these ambitious goals.

KSU stands as one of Saudi Arabia's premier higher education institutions, contributing significantly to the kingdom's academic and research landscape. A crucial part of KSU's contribution to Vision 2030 is through the King Abdullah Institution for Research and Consulting Studies (KAI), which operates as KSUâ€™s business center and contractual interface, bridging academics and the market.

In line with Vision 2030, KSU has established twenty-two Business Units (BUs), each within a respective college. However, these BUs face challenges due to the lack of a robust system for managing daily activities, leading to communication gaps, resource management issues, and complexities in everyday tasks.

To address these challenges and improve workflow management, we introduce the Business Gate project. This platform aims to improve the operational efficiency of BUs at KSU, streamline operations, enhance communication, and facilitate resource management.
